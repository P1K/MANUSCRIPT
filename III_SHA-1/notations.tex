\section{Notations}
\label{sec:not}

We use a few notations in this article. \autoref{table:symbs} gives the meaning of various standard symbols and \autoref{table:appbitconditions} shows the signification of the symbols used to denote bit differences between two states.
Additionally, we use the following conventions: \shaone states, messages, and expanded messages are respectively denoted by $\state$, $\mess$, $\expmess$; for a variable $x$, the corresponding variable related by a specific
difference is noted $\widetilde{x}$, the difference itself is denoted by $\diff(x,\widetilde{x})$ or $\diff x$; two different variables of the same type are noted $x$, $x'$ when their difference is not specific;
a variable that can be seen as an array can have its words accessed through a subscript, indices starting from zero, \eg $x_2$ is the third word of $x$; a variable that can be seen as a fixed-size binary number
can have its bits accessed through a bracket notation, indices starting from zero, \eg $x[31]$ is the thirty-second bit of $x$; 
numbers written in hexadecimal use a fixed-space font and the \emph{0x} prefix, \eg \texttt{0x1337}; we sometimes also write numbers in base two, in which case they are written with a subscript $b$, \eg $1010_b$. Finally, `$\defas$' is used to denote equality by definition.
Various additional shorthands are introduced throughout the text.
