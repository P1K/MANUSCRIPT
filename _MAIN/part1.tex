\section*{Overview}

The first part of this thesis serves as an introduction to the other two and to some of the
main topics of symmetric-key cryptography. The first two chapters respectively introduce block ciphers
and hash functions, which are the main objects studied in our work. The third and last chapter
describes a simple attack on \proestotr, an authenticated-encryption scheme. The prerequisites necessary
to understand this attack are minimal, and we believe it to be a fit introductory example to cryptanalysis.
