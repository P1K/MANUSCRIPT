\part[Collisions explicites pour la fonction de compression de \shaone]
    {Practical freestart collision attacks for \shaone} 
\label{part:sha-1}

\section*{Overview}
It's been a while since we learned that SHA-1 is weak against collision attacks. This paper gives an account of two practical collision attacks on its compression
function, including one on the full 80 steps. This is actually quite nice.
