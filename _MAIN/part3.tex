\part[Collisions explicites pour la fonction de compression de \shaone]
    {Practical freestart collision attacks for \shaone} 
\label{part:sha-1}

\section*{Overview}

The \shaone hash function was one of the first widely-deployed hash functions. It was designed by the NSA in 1995 as a modified version of 1993's \shazero (which itself
was more loosely inspired by 1990's \mdfour). In 2005, Wang \etal presented the first major attack on \shaone, giving a method to find colliisions for the hash function
in time equivalent to $\approx 2^{69}$ evaluations of the compression function, which is significantly faster than the $\approx 2^{80}$ required by a generic process.
However, the high cost of the attack implied that no explicit collision was computed at the time. This remains the case today, even if improvements to the attack
and ever more efficient hardware would make such an endeavour more affordable than it was in 2005.
The considerable amount of work that followed Wang \etal's original contribution then mostly focused on first getting a better understanding of the attack process and
second bringing innovations allowing to explicitly provide collisions for reduced versions of \shaone with the highest number of steps. 

\bigskip

In the third and last part of this thesis, we describe explicit collision attacks for the full compression function of \shaone. While this comes short of a practical
attack on the \emph{hash function}, this is the first explicit result on \shaone for a standard security notion. Furthermore, the efficient implementation framework that was developed
for this work could also be reused for hash function attacks, which have a very similar (and in some respect simpler) structure than our ``freestart'' case.

Collision attacks on \shaone \emph{à la} Wang have a rather specific structure, full of small technicalities. Thus, we start with a presentation of this topic in \autoref{cha:shaone_cont},
that we hope to be self-contained. Our contributions are presented next in \autoref{cha:shaone_new}.
